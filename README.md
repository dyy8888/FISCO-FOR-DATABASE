## Group Architecture

Our group architecture is designed to allow the simultaneous management of multiple ledger groups in the same blockchain network to facilitate speedy ledger setup and support massive service requests. This innovative architecture supports better scalability with key designs including inter-group transaction processing, distributed data storage, and intra-group consensus isolation. It aims to effectively scale up the business and simplify toilsome operational procedures while accommodating to data privacy protection requirements.

## Distributed Storage

Distributed storage framework aims to break the limitations of single-machine resource and boost system capacity and performance. It separates computation and storage units with modularized data exchange API for better flexibility. This framework simplifies data management and accelerate business development flow by defining standard CURD adaptors for common databases like MySQL, and supporting widely-used Key-Value and SQL-like data tables.

## Parallel Transaction Processing

Parallel transaction processing engine effectively exploits multi-core computation resources to parallelize transaction processing. To address key performance bottleneck caused high frequency and high complexity computation, it provides pre-compiled framework to run C++-based smart contracts, which significantly boosts the efficiency of transaction execution.

## Developer Friendly

FISCO BCOS provides various guides to compile and deploy blockchain instances, offering one-click deployment, speedy installation, and deployment on all mainstream platforms including Docker. It includes a comprehensive toolkit for speedy deployment, continuous monitoring, enterprise-level data governance, to save developers’ valuable time from toil.
